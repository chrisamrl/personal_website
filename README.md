## Description
My personal website made using GatsbyJS. Currently the layout is done, but there are a couple things I want to add in the future.
So I hosted it on Netlify to make modifying it easier. I'll add more styling as time goes by.

## Update
#### Oct 27:
Cleaned the commits, took so much longer than expected because it turned out I didn't know anything about git and I had to learn about git rebase.
The previous commits were awful so I had to clean it.
